### Task 0: Pre-Implementation Review & Validation

**Purpose:** Comprehensive review of task breakdown, implementation strategy, and technical viability before beginning development work.

**Dependencies:** None (blocking all other tasks)
**Blocks:** Tasks 10A-5B (all implementation tasks)
**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours

---

## Objectives

- [ ] Validate task breakdown completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Verify dependency graph is correct and optimal
- [ ] Identify missing tasks or edge cases
- [ ] Review technical approach for each task
- [ ] Assess time estimates for realism
- [ ] Check alignment with project goals (CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Identify potential blockers or risks
- [ ] Validate data integrity safeguards across all layers

## Review Checklist

### 1. Task Completeness Analysis
- [ ] Are all features from CLAUDE.md covered?
- [ ] Is the three-layer architecture (Source/Interpretation/Synthesis) fully implemented?
- [ ] Are all API endpoints needed accounted for?
- [ ] Are all UI pages/components needed accounted for?
- [ ] Are testing and validation tasks included?
- [ ] Are error handling and edge cases covered?

### 2. Dependency Graph Validation
- [ ] Are all task dependencies correctly identified?
- [ ] Are parallel execution opportunities maximized?
- [ ] Are there any circular dependencies?
- [ ] Is the critical path identified?
- [ ] Can any tasks be further parallelized?

### 3. Technical Approach Review
- [ ] Is the file upload approach secure and scalable?
- [ ] Are document parsers handling all edge cases (corrupted files, encoding issues)?
- [ ] Is the Claude API integration following best practices?
- [ ] Are confidence scores calculated consistently?
- [ ] Is source linking bidirectional and auditable?
- [ ] Are data structures aligned with TypeScript types?

### 4. Data Integrity & Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens if a source is deleted with active interpretations?
- [ ] How do we handle contradictory information across sources?
- [ ] What if Claude API is unavailable or rate-limited?
- [ ] How do we handle partial failures (e.g., 3 of 5 interpretations succeed)?
- [ ] What if uploaded file is empty or unparseable?
- [ ] How do we handle very large documents (>100 pages)?
- [ ] What about file uploads with special characters or unusual encodings?
- [ ] How do we version interpretations if user edits them?
- [ ] What if synthesized data references deleted interpretations?

### 5. Missing Functionality Check
- [ ] Do we need a "processing status" for long-running operations?
- [ ] Should we add batch processing for multiple sources?
- [ ] Do we need undo/redo for interpretation edits?
- [ ] Should there be a "draft" vs "approved" state for interpretations?
- [ ] Do we need user authentication (even for single-user MVP)?
- [ ] Should we add search/filter functionality for sources and interpretations?
- [ ] Do we need pagination for large lists?
- [ ] Should we support importing existing resume data (JSON)?

### 6. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Will file uploads work for 50MB PDFs?
- [ ] How many Claude API calls per source interpretation?
- [ ] Are we caching Claude responses appropriately?
- [ ] Will timeline visualization handle 20+ years of career data?
- [ ] Are we loading entire JSON files into memory?
- [ ] Should we implement streaming for large responses?

### 7. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Are uploaded files validated before processing?
- [ ] Is the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY properly secured?
- [ ] Are file paths sanitized to prevent directory traversal?
- [ ] Should we implement file encryption at rest?
- [ ] Are error messages avoiding data leakage?

### 8. User Experience Gaps
- [ ] Is there onboarding/help for first-time users?
- [ ] Are loading states clear and informative?
- [ ] Are error messages actionable?
- [ ] Is navigation between layers intuitive?
- [ ] Should we add keyboard shortcuts?
- [ ] Is there a way to track overall progress?

### 9. Time Estimate Validation
- [ ] Are 1-2 hour tasks realistic for the scope?
- [ ] Are 3-4 hour tasks too large?
- [ ] Total estimate: 25-35 hours reasonable for MVP?
- [ ] Should we add buffer time for debugging?

### 10. Alignment with CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Does task breakdown follow comment policy (minimal comments)?
- [ ] Are we using Tailwind CSS v4 correctly?
- [ ] Is light-mode-only approach followed?
- [ ] Are we following the task workflow (one task per commit)?
- [ ] Is stick figure branding incorporated?
- [ ] Are confidence scores using emerald/amber/red colors?
