### Task 7: Analyze Existing Task Files
- [x] Review all existing task files (task-3.md, task-4.md, task-5.md)
- [x] Map each task to project goals from Task 6
- [x] Identify gaps between tasks and stated project objectives
- [x] Check for redundant or overlapping tasks
- [x] Assess task ordering and dependencies
- [x] Document which tasks align with MVP vs future enhancements
- Location: `tasks/task-3.md`, `tasks/task-4.md`, `tasks/task-5.md`

## Analysis Results

### Existing Tasks Review

**Task 3: Interpretation Layer - Claude API Integration**
- Focus: Layer 2 (Interpreted/Normalized Layer)
- Core deliverables: Claude API client, interpretation prompts, normalization logic, review UI
- Status: Well-defined, MVP-aligned

**Task 4: Synthesis Layer - Timeline & Biography Generation**
- Focus: Layer 3 (Synthesized Layer)
- Core deliverables: Timeline generation, biography summaries, visualization components
- Status: Well-defined, MVP-aligned

**Task 5: Quality Assurance & Export Features**
- Focus: Cross-cutting concerns (validation, export, error handling)
- Core deliverables: Data integrity validation, export functionality, conflict resolution UI
- Status: Well-defined but broad scope

### Mapping to Project Goals

| Project Goal | Coverage | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Layer 1: Raw Sources | ‚ùå MISSING | No task for document upload, text extraction, source storage |
| Layer 2: Interpretations | ‚úÖ Task 3 | Complete coverage |
| Layer 3: Synthesis | ‚úÖ Task 4 | Complete coverage |
| Environment Setup | ‚ùå MISSING | No task for dependencies, .env, data directories, TypeScript types |
| Claude API Integration | ‚úÖ Tasks 3-4 | Covered for interpretation and synthesis |
| User Workflows | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Missing upload/extraction, has review/timeline/biography/export |
| Data Integrity | ‚úÖ Tasks 3-5 | Bidirectional linking, confidence scoring, validation |

### Critical Gaps Identified

**üö® MAJOR GAP: Task for Environment & Foundation Setup (Proposed Task 9)**
Missing foundational work:
- Install npm dependencies
- Create `.env.local` with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Create data directory structure (`/data/sources/`, `/data/interpreted/`, `/data/synthesized/`)
- Define TypeScript types for all three layers (`types/source.ts`, `types/interpretation.ts`, `types/synthesis.ts`)
- Verify Next.js configuration
- Set up Tailwind CSS v4 configuration

**üö® MAJOR GAP: Task for Source Layer Implementation (Proposed Task 10)**
Missing Layer 1 functionality:
- Document upload UI component (`app/upload/`)
- File parsers for PDF/DOCX/TXT (`lib/parsers/`)
- Source text extraction logic
- Source storage to `/data/sources/`
- Source management API endpoints (`app/api/parse/route.ts`)
- Source type definitions and validation

**Minor Gaps:**
- No task for base UI layout/navigation structure
- No task for dark mode implementation (mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- No explicit task for React error boundaries

### Redundancy & Overlap Analysis

**No significant redundancies found.**

Minor complementary overlap (acceptable):
- Conflict detection in Task 3 (detection logic) + Task 5 (resolution UI)
- These complement rather than duplicate each other

### Task Ordering & Dependencies

**Current Implicit Order:** Task 3 ‚Üí Task 4 ‚Üí Task 5

**Recommended Order with New Tasks:**

1. **Task 9: Environment & Foundation Setup** (NEW)
   - Dependencies: None
   - Blocks: All other tasks

2. **Task 10: Source Layer Implementation** (NEW)
   - Dependencies: Task 9
   - Blocks: Tasks 3, 4

3. **Task 3: Interpretation Layer**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 9, 10
   - Blocks: Task 4

4. **Task 4: Synthesis Layer**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 9, 10, 3
   - Blocks: None

5. **Task 5: Quality Assurance & Export**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 3, 4 (needs both layers to validate/export)
   - Blocks: None

**Critical Issue:** Current tasks 3-5 cannot start without Layer 1 (Task 10) and environment setup (Task 9).

### MVP vs Future Enhancements

**MVP-Aligned Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Task 3: Interpretation Layer (MVP required)
- ‚úÖ Task 4: Synthesis Layer (MVP required)
- ‚úÖ Task 5: Quality Assurance & Export (MVP required)
- ‚ùå Task 9: Environment Setup (MVP required, MISSING)
- ‚ùå Task 10: Source Layer (MVP required, MISSING)

**Future Enhancements (correctly excluded from current tasks):**
- Database migration (currently JSON files)
- Version control for interpretations
- Multi-user support
- LinkedIn/GitHub integration
- Automated source refresh

**Assessment:** All existing tasks are MVP-focused. No scope creep into future enhancements. Two critical MVP tasks are missing.

### Recommendations for Task 8

1. **Create Task 9:** Environment & Foundation Setup
2. **Create Task 10:** Source Layer Implementation (Layer 1)
3. **Update Task 3:** Add dependency on Tasks 9 & 10
4. **Update Task 4:** Add dependency on Tasks 9, 10 & 3
5. **Update Task 5:** Clarify it depends on Tasks 3 & 4
6. **Consider:** Add optional Task 11 for UI shell/navigation if desired
